# Budget from your Console!

Why you would ever want to do that is beyond me! But it was fun to make this little applicaiton. I guess I haven't made a console Application in a long while.

## Features

- Start with a sample budget
- Modify the budget as you so desire
- Track status of budgetted items (NONE, IGNORED, PENDING, CLEARED)
- View a month's summary (total expenses, total income, balances)
- Save budget as JSON
- Load previously saved budgets

## Project Management

**Todos**

- Add a column for `Due Date`
- Sort by column
- Organize by category
- (maybe?) Color negatives values in Red

**Done**

- ~~Commit all code to new repository and write a basic README~~
- ~~Added header color green which looks like the Matrix, nice!~~
- ~~Edit budget item by Index~~
- ~~Delete budget item by Index~~
- ~~Change the status of a budget item by Index~~

**Roadmap**

- Make Console renderer use a template based system
- Generally make the layout of the budget more user-friendly (but hey, it's a console app!)
